1. The number of orphan planets (no star).
2. The name (planet identifier) of the planet orbiting the hottest star.
3. A timeline of the number of planets discovered per year grouped by size. Use the following groups: “small” is less than 1 Jupiter radii,
“medium” is less than 2 Jupiter radii, and anything bigger is considered “large”. For example, in 2004 we discovered 2 small planets, 
 5 medium planets, and 0 large planets.
